# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

I would tell the computer that they should be trying to hinder me from getting three shapes/ letters in a row while also advancing themselves to get three shapes/letters in a row in the most efficient way possible ( like add a time parameter for them to try and adhere to ).
